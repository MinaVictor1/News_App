My Awesome App is a mobile application that provides the latest news and allows users to search for specific news articles.

## Architecture

My Awesome App follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. This architecture separates the presentation logic from the business logic, making the code more modular and maintainable.

## Navigation

For navigation between different screens in the app, we use GoRouter. GoRouter is a lightweight navigation library that simplifies the navigation process and provides a declarative way to define routes and handle navigation actions.

## State Management

In My Awesome App, we utilize Cubit for state management. Cubit is a lightweight and reactive state management solution that helps manage and propagate application state changes efficiently. It follows the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern and provides a simple way to handle state updates and events.

## Splash View

The Splash View is the first page the user sees when they open the app. It displays a branded logo and a loading animation while the app initializes.
